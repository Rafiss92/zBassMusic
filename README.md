# zBassMusic
zBassMusic is a modern music system for Gothic I and Gothic II NotR based on [BASS Audio Library](https://www.un4seen.com/) distributed as a Union plugin. It replaces the old DirectMusic system to let the modders create music for Gothic as regular audio files instead of unfriendly DirectMusic format.  

Features:
* Music playback with modern audio formats like WAV, MP3, OGG
* Out-of-the-box support for existing `C_MUSICTHEME` instances 
* Scriptable interface to take full control of music scheduling
* Loading music files from VDFS volumes (excluding .sgt)
* Backwards compatibility with DirectMusic .sgt files
